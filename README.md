# TrackingOracle_Cardano

README for USPS Tracking Data Oracle Using Cardano Blockchain
Project Overview
This project involves creating a Python-based oracle that fetches package tracking information from the United States Postal Service (USPS) API and then sends this data to the Cardano blockchain using the Blockfrost API. The primary goal is to bridge real-world data (package tracking information) with the blockchain, allowing for decentralized verification and storage of this data.

Components
USPS API Integration: Fetches tracking information based on tracking numbers. This part of the oracle interacts with the USPS API to retrieve the status and details of packages.

Blockfrost API Integration: Sends the fetched tracking information to the Cardano blockchain. Utilizes Blockfrost, a service providing simplified access to the Cardano blockchain, to record data.

Python Flask Application: Acts as the backend server, hosting the oracle functionality. It provides an endpoint to trigger the data fetching and blockchain recording process.

Cardano Blockchain: Records the tracking information in a decentralized and immutable manner. The implementation details on the blockchain side depend on the specifics of the smart contract used.

Functionality
The Python application fetches tracking data from the USPS API using a tracking number.
After fetching the data, the application formats it as required by the Cardano blockchain (typically as transaction metadata).
The application then uses Blockfrost to send this data to the Cardano blockchain, effectively recording the tracking information in a transaction.
The application handles authentication with the USPS API and Blockfrost API, error handling, and transaction submission to the Cardano blockchain.
How to Use
Setup: Install the required Python packages, including Flask and Blockfrost SDK. Set up API keys for both USPS and Blockfrost.

Running the Application: Start the Flask application. It listens for requests to fetch tracking data and send it to the blockchain.

Interacting with the Application: Use the provided endpoint to submit tracking number queries. The application will handle the rest, from fetching data to recording it on the blockchain.

Viewing Blockchain Transactions: Once the data is sent to the Cardano blockchain, it can be viewed and verified using a Cardano blockchain explorer.

Security and Compliance
Ensure API keys and sensitive data are securely stored and not exposed.
Comply with all relevant regulations regarding data sharing and blockchain transactions.
Testing and Deployment
Thoroughly test the application in a development environment, especially the blockchain interactions.
Use Cardano testnet for initial testing before moving to the mainnet.
Future Enhancements
Improve error handling and logging for robustness.
Explore the potential for more complex interactions with Cardano smart contracts
